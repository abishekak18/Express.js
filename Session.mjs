/*The session middleware is used to store session data on the server. This data is then associated with a session ID, which is stored in a cookie on the client side. The session data can be accessed and modified throughout the user's session.*/
/*
secret: A string (or array) used to sign the session ID cookie. This ensures the cookie cannot be tampered with.
resave: When set to false, the session is not saved back to the session store if it wasnâ€™t modified during the request.
saveUninitialized: When set to true, sessions that are new but not modified will be saved. Setting this to false is often preferred for login sessions or compliance reasons.
cookie: Contains settings for the session cookie (e.g., maxAge, secure, httpOnly). Note that if you set secure: true, the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS.*/
